# StriatalLearning Library
Python Library to model learning of pattern classification task with striatal neurons.
Work done during PhD thesis of Gaëtan Vignoud (Inria and CIRB, Collège de France) under the joint-supervision of Laurent Venance (CIRB, Collège de France) and Jonathan Touboul (Math Dept., Brandeis University). All experimental data was collected at the Dynamic and Pathophysiology of Neuronal Networks team at CIRB (https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/en-cirb/venance.htm).
